# About the shell script in this directory

The shell script in this directory is mainly for testing and development. During development, I run Taupe from a terminal emulator by starting it simply like this:

```sh
./taupe
```

When Taupe is installed on a computer using `pip` or `pipx`, a different wrapper script is installed, not the one that is in this directory. The one here is merely a convenience.
