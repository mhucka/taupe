# Change log for Taupe

## Version 1.1.0 (2022-11-22)

This update brings more output format options. The option `--extract` now accepts many more values to control the output. For example, It is now possible to produce a plain list of URLs of your tweets. Please see the help text or the [README](https://github.com/mhucka/taupe#the-structure-of-the-output) for the details.


## Version 1.0.0 (2022-11-18)

Changes since the last release:
* The [README](https://github.com/mhucka/taupe/blob/main/README.md) has been edited and enhanced.
* The help text printed for `taupe --help` has been edited to (hopefully) improve clarity.


## Version 0.0.1

First release of complete working version.
